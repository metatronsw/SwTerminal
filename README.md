# SwTerminal

## The Swift Terminal extension

It's a simple and powerful addition to the String structure, making it easy to control the Terminal. You can color the letters, the background, move the cursor, clear the screen.

A collection of many useful functions you can use with the terminal.
It is important to note that the XCode console is not a real terminal, so it cannot display coloured letters or move the cursor.
